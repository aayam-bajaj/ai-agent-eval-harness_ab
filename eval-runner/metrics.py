metrics.py

This module defines evaluation metrics for the AI Agent Evaluation Harness.
It provides functions to assess agent performance on tool usage, accuracy, and communication clarity.

Typical usage example:
    from eval_runner import metrics
    score = metrics.calculate_tool_call_correctness(["search"], ["search"])
"""
# eval-runner/metrics.py


def calculate_tool_call_correctness(expected_tools: list, actual_tools: list) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the correctness of tool calls by the agent.
    Returns 1.0 if the sets of tools match exactly, 0.0 otherwise.

    Args:
        expected_tools (list): A list of tool names the agent was expected to use.
        actual_tools (list): A list of tool names the agent actually used.

    Returns:
        float: A score of 1.0 for a perfect match, 0.0 otherwise.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_tool_call_correctness(["search"], ["search"])
        1.0
        >>> calculate_tool_call_correctness(["search"], ["lookup"])
        0.0

    print(
        f"      [Metrics] Comparing expected tools {expected_tools} vs. actual {actual_tools}"
    )
    return 1.0 if set(expected_tools) == set(actual_tools) else 0.0


def calculate_generic_accuracy() -> float:
    """
    Placeholder function to simulate a successful metric calculation.
    In a real scenario, this would involve comparing the agent's output to a ground-truth answer.

    Returns:
        float: A score, hardcoded to 1.0 for this simulation.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_generic_accuracy()
        1.0
    """
    # TODO: Replace with actual metric logic (e.g., NLP-based comparison, exact match).
    return 1.0


def calculate_communication_clarity() -> float:
    """
    Placeholder function to simulate a successful communication clarity check.
    In a real scenario, this would involve NLP analysis of the agent's response.

    Returns:
        float: A score, hardcoded to 1.0 for this simulation.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_communication_clarity()
        1.0
    """
    # TODO: Replace with actual metric logic (e.g., NLP-based comparison).
    return 1.0


# You can add many more specific metrics here, for example:
# - def calculate_response_relevance(agent_response, expected_summary): ...
# - def calculate_sentiment_alignment(agent_response_sentiment, expected_sentiment): ...
# - def calculate_f1_score_for_classification(agent_labels, true_labels): ...
